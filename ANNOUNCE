I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.0.5

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

The main news in this release:

o Wheel binary compatibility fix for Python >= 3.7, < 3.7.4
o Prefix thread states with interpreter number in RootState
o Made first heap call faster
o Use _PySys_GetSizeOf as default size getter
o Allow xt_hd_traverse to be KeyboardInterrupt-ed
